# Rust Track Problem Order

The actual source of truth of problem order and topics is [config.json](config.json), but this file documents our reasoning behind the problem order in that file.

# The Problems, By Section

## Introduction

The first section contains the sort of stuff you expect when learning any programming languages: conditionals, booleans, looping and some higher-order functions.

* hello-world
* gigasecond
* leap
* raindrops
* bob
* beer-song
* difference-of-squares
* sum-of-multiples
* grains

## Getting Rusty

Problems begin to use more Rust-specific features. Try to only introduce one new language feature at a time. And if several problems rely on a feature, try to group them so as to reinforce its usage.

* hamming
* pascals-triangle
* scrabble-score
* pangram
* nucleotide-count
* largest-series-product
* word-count
* atbash-cipher
* etl
* acronym
* sieve
* rna-transcription
* triangle
* roman-numerals
* all-your-base
* grade-school
* robot-simulator
* bracket-push
* queen-attack
* bowling
* sublist
* space-age
* allergies
* variable-length-quantity
* phone-number
* wordy
* tournament
* custom-set
* alphametics

## Rust Gets Strange

Exercises that pay the cost of Rust's [strangeness budget](http://words.steveklabnik.com/the-language-strangeness-budget). Features that are very specific to Rust.

* anagram
* nucleotide-codons
* robot-name

## Putting it all Together

These problems donâ€™t necessarily require additional Rust knowledge, but they do require complex solutions.

* ocr-numbers
* minesweeper
* dominoes
* parallel-letter-frequency
* rectangles
* forth
* circular-buffer
* react
