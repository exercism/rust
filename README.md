Hi. &nbsp;👋🏽 &nbsp;👋 &nbsp;**We are happy you are here.**&nbsp; 🎉&nbsp;🌟

<br>

**`exercism/rust`** is one of many programming language tracks on [exercism(dot)org][exercism-website].
This repo holds all the instructions, tests, code, & support files for Rust _exercises_ currently under development or implemented & available for students.

blabla do not merge this.
changing the readme should not trigger the comment.

Some Exercism language tracks have a **syllabus** which is meant to teach the language step-by-step.
The Rust track's syllabus is a work in progress and it's not activated yet.
All exercises presented to students are **practice exercises**.
Students are exepcted to learn the language themselves, for example with the [official book][the-rust-programming-language], and practice with our exercises.
