# Installation

To get the recommended installation instructions for your platform,
head over to [the official Rust website].

Having the toolchain installed is not everything!
IDE support is a huge productivity boost that most developers have come to expect.
If you are using Visual Studio Code, check out its [documentation for Rust support][vscode].
We also recommend you whole-heartedly to enable [linting with clippy][vscode-linting]!
