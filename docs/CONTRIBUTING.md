## Merging Philosophy

A [pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/github-glossary#pull-request) should address one logical change.
This could be small or big.

For example, [#1174](https://github.com/exercism/rust/pull/1174) fixed a single typo in a single file after minutes of collaboration.

It was a small, short pull request with one logical change.

[#653](https://github.com/exercism/rust/pull/653) introduced the doubly linked list exercise after months of collaboration.

It was a big, long-running pull request with one logical change.
