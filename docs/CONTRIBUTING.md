# Contributing to the Rust Exercism Track

This document is a work-in-progress.
Current maintainers are primarily preparing for the v3 launch of the Rust track.
Nonetheless, feel free to peruse what we have written thus far!

*Contributions welcome :)*

Thank you so much for contributing! :tada:
As one of the many tracks in Exercism, contributions here should observe Exercism standards like the [Code of Conduct](https://exercism.io/code-of-conduct).
This document introduces the ways you can help and what maintainers expect of contributors.

## Ways to Contribute

As with many Open Source projects, work abounds.
Here are a few categories of welcome contribution:
- improving existing exercises
- creating new exercises
- improving internal tooling

## Merging Philosophy

A [pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/github-glossary#pull-request) should address one logical change.
This could be small or big.

For example, [#1175](https://github.com/exercism/rust/pull/1175) fixed a single typo in a single file after minutes of collaboration.

It was a small, short pull request with one logical change.

[#653](https://github.com/exercism/rust/pull/653) introduced the doubly linked list exercise after months of collaboration.

It was a big, long-running pull request with one logical change.
