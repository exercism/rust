Rust is a fast compiled language which supports functional, imperative, and object-oriented
programming. It has built-in memory safety without garbage collection and is ideal for
systems and low-level programming, while still retaining the abstractions of a higher-level
language.

Rust has excellent documentation and a beginner-friendly community. Dive right in at [the Rust
  website] (https://www.rust-lang.org/).
