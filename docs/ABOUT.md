Rust aims to bring modern language design and an advanced type system to systems programming. Rust does not use a garbage collector, but instead ensures safety and optimizes code at compile time. The concept of [ownership](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ownership.html) is how Rust achieves its largest goal, memory safety.

Rust core and the standard library contain a minimal set of functionality. Rustaceans are encouraged to add features, in the form of libraries called _crates_, to the language and then share them on [crates.io](https://crates.io/).

As a systems-level language, Rust is frequently used for building any tool where speed, performance and stability are paramount. The [Awesome Rust](https://github.com/kud1ing/awesome-rust) list collects examples of Rust projects, which include CLI tools, ORMs, operating systems and games. Regardless of what you build in Rust, it will be fast and memory safe!

The home page for Rust is [rust-lang.org](https://www.rust-lang.org/). Rust has excellent documentation at [rust-lang.org/documentation.html](https://www.rust-lang.org/documentation.html). Newcomers should start with "The Book" located at [doc.rust-lang.org/book/](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/).
