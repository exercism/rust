Rust is a systems programming language focused on three goals: safety, speed, and concurrency. Rust does not use a garbage collector, but instead ensures safety and optimizes code at compile time. The concept of [ownership](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ownership.html) is how Rust achieves its largest goal, memory safety.

Rust core and the standard library contain a minimal set of functionality. Rustaceans are encouraged to add features, in the form of libraries called _crates_, to the language and then share them on [crates.io](https://crates.io/).

The home page for Rust is [rust-lang.org](https://www.rust-lang.org/). Rust has excellent documentation at [rust-lang.org/documentation.html](https://www.rust-lang.org/documentation.html). Newcomers should start with "The Book" located at [doc.rust-lang.org/book/](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/).
