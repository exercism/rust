# Introduction

Loops enable repetition of blocks of code. There are three types of loops in Rust: the `for` loop that enables looping over elements of a collection, the `while` loop that repeates a block of code as long as a condition is satisfied and the `loop` loop that indefinitely repeats code until a `break` is invoked explicitly.
