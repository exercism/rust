# Methods

Methods are functions defined for a struct (or an `enum` or `trait` object). Methods are similar to functions: they are declared with the `fn` keyword, they have a name, and they can have parameters and return values.

And their first parameter is always self, which represents the instance of the struct the method is being called on.
