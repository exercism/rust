# Introduction

Integers are numbers with no digits behind the decimal separator (whole numbers).

Integer types can either store only positive numbers (unsigned) or store either positive and negative numbers (signed).

Examples are -6, 0, 1, 25 and 976.

Note that you can use underscores to improve the readability of longer numbers: `1_000_000`.
