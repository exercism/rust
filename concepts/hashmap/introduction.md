# Introduction

Hashmap is a collection used to store key-value pairs. It allows arbitrary and user-defined types to be used as keys to index into it (technically any type that implement `Eq` and `Hash` traits can be used as keys). Hashmap have fast insertion and retrieval functions and are very useful in e.g., making frequency counts, storing relationships etc.,. Hashmap also features the powerful `entry` API that makes it ergonomic to use.
