# About

Rust enums are also called [algebraic data types](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_data_type), or [tagged unions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tagged_union). Why does this matter? Enumerations are a popular concept and programming languages implement them differently. Functional programming has influenced Rust's design and the `enum` implementation demonstrates that.
