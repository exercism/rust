# Introduction

Destructuring is a way to break apart compound values in Rust. It is often used to extract fields from tuples or structs.

For example, the below snippet extracts two values from a tuple:

```rust
let (first, second) = (1, 2);
```

The value `1` is bound to the variable `first`.
The value `2` is bound to the variable `second`.
