Destructuring is a way to break apart values in Rust. It is often used when extracting values from tupes or structs.

For example, the below snippet extracts two values from a tuple:
```rust
let (first, second) = (1, 2);
```

The value `1` is bound to the variable `first`.
The value `2` is bound to the variable `second`.
