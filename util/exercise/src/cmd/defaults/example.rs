//! Example implementation
//!
//! - Implement the solution to your exercise here.
//! - Put the stubs for any tested functions in `src/lib.rs`,
//!   whose variable names are `_` and
//!   whose contents are `unimplemented!()`.
//! - If your example implementation has dependencies, copy
//!   `Cargo.toml` into `Cargo-example.toml` and then make
//!   any modifications necessary to the latter so your example will run.
//! - Test your example by running `../../bin/test-exercise`
