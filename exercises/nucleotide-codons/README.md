# Nucleotide Codons

Write a function that returns the name of an amino acid a particular codon,
possibly using shorthand, encodes for.

In DNA sequences of 3 nucleotides, called codons, encode for amino acids. Often
several codons encode for the same amino acid. The International Union of Pure
and Applied Chemistry developed a shorthand system for designating groups of
codons that encode for the same amino acid.

Simply put they've expanded the four letters A, C, G and T with a bunch of
letters that stand for different possibilities. For example R means A and G.
So TAR stands for TAA and TAG (think of "TAR" as "TA[AG]" in regex notation).

Write some code that given a codon, which may use shorthand, returns the
name of the amino acid that that codon encodes for. You will be given
a list of non-shorthand-codon/name pairs to base your computation on.

See: [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_codon_table).

## Rust Installation

Refer to the [exercism help page][help-page] for Rust installation and learning
resources.

## Writing the Code

Execute the tests with:

```bash
$ cargo test
```

All but the first test have been ignored. After you get the first test to
pass, open the tests source file which is located in the `tests` directory
and remove the `#[ignore]` flag from the next test and get the tests to pass
again. Each separate test is a function with `#[test]` flag above it.
Continue, until you pass every test.

If you wish to run all tests without editing the tests source file, use:

```bash
$ cargo test -- --ignored
```

To run a specific test, for example `some_test`, you can use:

```bash
$ cargo test some_test
```

If the specific test is ignored use:

```bash
$ cargo test some_test -- --ignored
```

To learn more about Rust tests refer to the [online test documentation][rust-tests]

Make sure to read the [Modules](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch07-02-modules-and-use-to-control-scope-and-privacy.html) chapter if you
haven't already, it will help you with organizing your files.

## Further improvements

After you have solved the exercise, please consider using the additional utilities, described in the [installation guide](https://exercism.io/tracks/rust/installation), to further refine your final solution.

To format your solution, inside the solution directory use

```bash
cargo fmt
```

To see, if your solution contains some common ineffective use cases, inside the solution directory use

```bash
cargo clippy --all-targets
```

## Submitting the solution

Generally you should submit all files in which you implemented your solution (`src/lib.rs` in most cases). If you are using any external crates, please consider submitting the `Cargo.toml` file. This will make the review process faster and clearer.
