# Protein Translation

Translate RNA sequences into proteins.

RNA can be broken into three nucleotide sequences called codons, and then translated to a polypeptide like so:

RNA: `"AUGUUUUCU"` => translates to

Codons: `"AUG", "UUU", "UCU"`
=> which become a polypeptide with the following sequence =>

Protein: `"Methionine", "Phenylalanine", "Serine"`
 
There are 64 codons which in turn correspond to 20 amino acids; however, all of the codon sequences and resulting amino acids are not important in this exercise.  If it works for one codon, the program should work for all of them.
However, feel free to expand the list in the test suite to include them all.  

There are also four terminating codons (also known as 'STOP' codons); if any of these codons are encountered (by the ribosome), all translation ends and the protein is terminated.

All subsequent codons after are ignored, like this:

RNA: `"AUGUUUUCUUAAAUG"` =>

Codons: `"AUG", "UUU", "UCU", "UAG", "AUG"` => 

Protein: `"Methionine", "Phenylalanine", "Serine"`

Note the stop codon terminates the translation and the final methionine is not translated into the protein sequence.

Below are the codons and resulting Amino Acids needed for the exercise.

Codon                 | Protein
:---                  | :---
AUG                   | Methionine
UUU, UUC              | Phenylalanine
UUA, UUG              | Leucine
UCU, UCC, UCA, UCG    | Serine
UAU, UAC              | Tyrosine
UGU, UGC              | Cysteine
UGG                   | Tryptophan
UAA, UAG, UGA         | STOP

## Rust Installation

Refer to the [exercism help page][help-page] for Rust installation and learning
resources.

## Writing the Code

Execute the tests with:

```bash
$ cargo test
```

All but the first test have been ignored.  After you get the first test to
pass, remove the ignore flag (`#[ignore]`) from the next test and get the tests
to pass again.  The test file is located in the `tests` directory.   You can
also remove the ignore flag from all the tests to get them to run all at once
if you wish.

Make sure to read the [Crates and Modules](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/crates-and-modules.html) chapter if you
haven't already, it will help you with organizing your files.
