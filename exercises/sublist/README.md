# Sublist

Given two lists determine if the first list is contained within the second
list, if the second list is contained within the first list, if both lists are
contained within each other or if none of these are true.

Specifically, a list A is a sublist of list B if by dropping 0 or more elements
from the front of B and 0 or more elements from the back of B you get a list
that's completely equal to A.

Examples:

 * A = [1, 2, 3], B = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], A is a sublist of B
 * A = [3, 4, 5], B = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], A is a sublist of B
 * A = [3, 4], B = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], A is a sublist of B
 * A = [1, 2, 3], B = [1, 2, 3], A is equal to B
 * A = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], B = [2, 3, 4], A is a superlist of B
 * A = [1, 2, 4], B = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], A is not a superlist of, sublist of or equal to B

## Rust Installation

Refer to the [exercism help page][help-page] for Rust installation and learning
resources.

## Writing the Code

Execute the tests with:

```bash
$ cargo test
```

All but the first test have been ignored.  After you get the first test to
pass, remove the ignore flag (`#[ignore]`) from the next test and get the tests
to pass again.  The test file is located in the `tests` directory.   You can
also remove the ignore flag from all the tests to get them to run all at once
if you wish.

Make sure to read the [Modules](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/second-edition/ch07-00-modules.html) chapter if you
haven't already, it will help you with organizing your files.
