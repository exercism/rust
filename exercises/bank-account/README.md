# Bank Account

Simulate a bank account supporting opening/closing, withdrawals, and deposits
of money. Watch out for concurrent transactions!

A bank account can be accessed in multiple ways. Clients can make
deposits and withdrawals using the internet, mobile phones, etc. Shops
can charge against the account.

Create an account that can be accessed from multiple threads/processes
(terminology depends on your programming language).

It should be possible to close an account; operations against a closed
account must fail.

## Instructions

Run the test file, and fix each of the errors in turn. When you get the
first test to pass, go to the first pending or skipped test, and make
that pass as well. When all of the tests are passing, feel free to
submit.

Remember that passing code is just the first step. The goal is to work
towards a solution that is as readable and expressive as you can make
it.

Have fun!

## Rust Installation

Refer to the [exercism help page][help-page] for Rust installation and learning
resources.

## Writing the Code

Execute the tests with:

```bash
$ cargo test
```

All but the first test have been ignored.  After you get the first test to
pass, remove the ignore flag (`#[ignore]`) from the next test and get the tests
to pass again.  The test file is located in the `tests` directory.   You can
also remove the ignore flag from all the tests to get them to run all at once
if you wish.

Make sure to read the [Modules](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/second-edition/ch07-00-modules.html) chapter if you
haven't already, it will help you with organizing your files.
