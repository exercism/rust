# Hints

## General

- Use the `enum-iterator` crate to be able to iterate over enums. Check out [docs](https://docs.rs/enum-iterator/1.1.1/enum_iterator/) to find out how.

- Use the `int-enum` crate to be able to convert from int to enum. See the [docs](https://docs.rs/int-enum/0.4.0/int_enum/) for details.

- The `Debug` trait is there because you'll likely need it.

- You'll need to extend the list of `derive`d traits on your colors enum.
