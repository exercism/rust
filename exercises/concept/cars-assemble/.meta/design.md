# Design

## Learning objectives

- Know of the existence of the two default number types, `i32` and `f64`.
- Understand that an `i32` represents whole numbers, and a `f64` represents floating-point numbers.
- Know of basic operators such as multiplication, comparison and equality.
- Know how to convert from one numeric type to another.
- Know how to conditionally execute code using an `if` statement.

## Out of scope

- Any other numeric types besides `i32` and `f64` (so no `float`, `byte`, etc.).
- Parsing a `string` to an `i32` or `f64`.
- Converting an `i32` or `f64` to a `string`.

## Concepts

- `integers`: know about `i32` and `f64` types
- `if-statements`: know how to conditionally execute code using an `if` statement.
- `math-operators`: know the math operators; know about precedence; know the role of parentheses
- `assignment`: know the syntax and behavior of assignment in OO languages

## Prerequisites

- `booleans`
