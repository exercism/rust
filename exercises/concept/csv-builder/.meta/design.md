# Goal

Teach the student the differences between String and &str and how to work successfully with both.
Learning objectives

    Know String is owned and mutable
    Know &str is shared and immutable
    Know String has &str methods because of shared traits
    Know of performance characteristics
    Machine level representation of either

## Out of scope
