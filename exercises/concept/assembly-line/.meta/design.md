# Design

## Learning objectives

- Know how number literals are represented in Rust
- Know the different types of integer and floating point primitives
- Know how to cast
- primitive bit sizes and type casting

## Out of scope

- Arithmetic
- Definitely not arithmetic traits like `Add` and `Sub`, best to introduce with methods
- Mutable variables

## Concepts

- Numbers
- Integers
- Floating point values (basic)

## Prerequisites

None

## Representer

This exercise does not require any specific representation logic to be added to the representer.

## Analyzer

This exercise does not require any specific logic to be added to the analyzer.
