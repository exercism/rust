# Design

## Goal

Introduce the `push()` and `pop()` methods of `Vec`.

## Learning objectives

- Know what `push()` and `pop()` do.
- Know how to use the values returned by `pop()`.

## Out of scope

- Specific Error hadling
- other ways to instantiate `Vec<T>`

## Concepts

The Concepts this exercise unlocks are:

- `vec-index`: for O(1) access to elements in vectors

## Prerequisites

- intro-fn
- numbers
- option
