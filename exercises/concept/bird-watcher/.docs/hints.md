# Hints

## 1. Determine the total number of birds you've recorded so for

+ Iterate over the vector by refering to the example in the introduction

+ Use the `sum` method while iterating to compute the total

## 2. Calculate the number of birds in a specific week

+ Create a slice of the vector

+ Iterate over and sum the slice.

## 3. Fix a counting mistake

+ Odd days would translate to even indices

+ Iterate over the vector by refering to the example in the introduction

+ Use the `step_by` method to perform custom increment

+ Use the `sum` method while using `take`

## 4. Determine the number of birds that visited today

+ Use the `last` method to get the last element from the vector

## 5. Determine day with no visiting birds

+ Use the `contains` method to check for a value

## 6. Calculate the number of busy days

+ Use a counter to keep track of the iteration

+ Iterate over the vector by refering to the example in the introduction

+ Check if the bird count is 5 or more and adjust the counter accordingly

## 7. Calculate the number of birds in the first N days

+ Iterate over the vector by refering to the example in the introduction

+ Use the `take` method while iterating

+ Use the `sum` method while using `take`
