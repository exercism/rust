# Design

## Learning objectives

- Know what the `struct` keyword means
- Know how to create `struct`s
- Know how to define methods on `struct`s using the `impl` keyword
- Know the basics of different kinds of `struct`s

## Out of scope

- representation in memory
- advanced treatment of
  - generic structs
  - unit structs (zero-sized structs)
  - tuple structs

## Concepts

- structs

## Prerequisites
