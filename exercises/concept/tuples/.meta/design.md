# Design

## Goal

Introduce the student to tuples and how to work with them.

## Learning objectives

- know how to create tuples and tuple structs
- understand positional tuple access syntax `a_tuple.0`
- know how to destructure tuples into new variables, e.g. `let (x, y) = a_point;`;

## Out of scope

- enum variants with tuple structs

## Concepts

- tuples
- destructuring

## Prerequisites

- structs
