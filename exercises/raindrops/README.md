# Raindrops

Convert a number to a string, the contents of which depend on the number's factors.

- If the number has 3 as a factor, output 'Pling'.
- If the number has 5 as a factor, output 'Plang'.
- If the number has 7 as a factor, output 'Plong'.
- If the number does not have 3, 5, or 7 as a factor,
  just pass the number's digits straight through.

## Examples

- 28's factors are 1, 2, 4, **7**, 14, 28.
  - In raindrop-speak, this would be a simple "Plong".
- 30's factors are 1, 2, **3**, **5**, 6, 10, 15, 30.
  - In raindrop-speak, this would be a "PlingPlang".
- 34 has four factors: 1, 2, 17, and 34.
  - In raindrop-speak, this would be "34".

## Rust Installation

Refer to the [exercism help page][help-page] for Rust installation and learning
resources.

## Writing the Code

Execute the tests with:

```bash
$ cargo test
```

All but the first test have been ignored. After you get the first test to
pass, open the tests source file wich is located in the `tests` directory
and remove the `#[ignore]` flag from the next test and get the tests to pass
again. Each separate test is a function with `#[test]` flag above it.
Continue, until you pass every test. 

If you wish to run all tests without editing the tests source file, use:

```bash
$ cargo test -- --ignored
```

To run a specific test, for example `some_test`, you can use:

```bash
$ cargo test some_test
```

If the specfic test is ignored use:

```bash
$ cargo test some_test -- --ignored
```

To learn more about Rust tests refer to the [online test documentation][rust-tests]

Make sure to read the [Modules](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/second-edition/ch07-00-modules.html) chapter if you
haven't already, it will help you with organizing your files.
