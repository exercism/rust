## Rust Specific Exercise Notes

This is slightly changed in the Rust version, compared to other
language versions of this exercise.  Instead of requiring you to return
errors for out of range, we are using Rust's strong type system to limit
input.  It is much easier to make a function deal with all valid inputs,
rather than requiring the user of your module to handle errors.

There is a -1 version of a test case, but it is commented out.
If your function is implemented properly, the -1 test case should not compile.

Adding 'and' into number text has not been implemented in test cases.

### Extension

Add capability of converting up to the max value for u64: 9,223,372,036,854,775,807.

For hints at the output this should have, look at the last test case.
