# Rotational Cipher

Create an implementation of the rotational cipher, also sometimes called the Caesar cipher.

The Caesar cipher is a simple shift cipher that relies on
transposing all the letters in the alphabet using an integer key
between `0` and `26`. Using a key of `0` or `26` will always yield
the same output due to modular arithmetic. The letter is shifted
for as many values as the value of the key.

The general notation for rotational ciphers is `ROT + <key>`.
The most commonly used rotational cipher is `ROT13`.

A `ROT13` on the Latin alphabet would be as follows:

```text
Plain:  abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz
Cipher: nopqrstuvwxyzabcdefghijklm
```

It is stronger than the Atbash cipher because it has 27 possible keys, and 25 usable keys.

Ciphertext is written out in the same formatting as the input including spaces and punctuation.

## Examples

- ROT5  `omg` gives `trl`
- ROT0  `c` gives `c`
- ROT26 `Cool` gives `Cool`
- ROT13 `The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.` gives `Gur dhvpx oebja sbk whzcf bire gur ynml qbt.`
- ROT13 `Gur dhvpx oebja sbk whzcf bire gur ynml qbt.` gives `The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.`

## Rust Installation

Refer to the [exercism help page][help-page] for Rust installation and learning
resources.

## Writing the Code

Execute the tests with:

```bash
$ cargo test
```

All but the first test have been ignored.  After you get the first test to
pass, remove the ignore flag (`#[ignore]`) from the next test and get the tests
to pass again.  The test file is located in the `tests` directory.   You can
also remove the ignore flag from all the tests to get them to run all at once
if you wish.

Make sure to read the [Modules](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/second-edition/ch07-00-modules.html) chapter if you
haven't already, it will help you with organizing your files.
