# Decimal

Implement an arbitrary-precision `Decimal` class.

Floating point numbers are the most common representation of non-integer real numbers in computing, and they're a common standard defined by [IEEE 754](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_754). They're very flexible and versatile, but they do have some limitations. Famously, in floating point arithmetic, [`0.1 + 0.2 != 0.3`](http://0.30000000000000004.com/).

The solution to this issue is to find another, lossless way to model arbitrary-precision non-integer reals. This may be less efficient in terms of memory or processing speed than floating point numbers; the goal is to provide exact results.

Despite `Decimal` being a custom type, we should still be able to treat them as numbers: the `==`, `<`, `>`, `+`, `-`, and `*` operators should all work as expected on Decimals. For expediency, you are not required to implement division, as arbitrary-precision division can very quickly get out of hand. (How do you represent arbitrary-precision `1/3`?)

In Rust, the way to get these operations on custom types is to implement the relevant traits for your custom object. In particular, you'll need to implement at least `PartialEq`, `PartialOrd`, `Add`, `Sub`, and `Mul`. Strictly speaking, given that the decimal numbers form a total ordering, you should also implement `Eq` and `Ord`, though those traits are not checked for by these tests.

# Note

It would be very easy to implement this exercise by using the [bigdecimal](https://crates.io/crates/bigdecimal) crate. Don't do that; implement this yourself.

# Hints

- Instead of implementing arbitrary-precision arithmetic from scratch, consider building your type on top of the [num_bigint](https://crates.io/crates/num-bigint) crate.
- You might be able to [derive](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/2018-edition/appendix-03-derivable-traits.html) some of the required traits.
- `Decimal` is assumed to be a signed type. You do not have to create a separate unsigned type, though you may do so as an implementation detail if you so choose.

## Rust Installation

Refer to the [exercism help page][help-page] for Rust installation and learning
resources.

## Writing the Code

Execute the tests with:

```bash
$ cargo test
```

All but the first test have been ignored. After you get the first test to
pass, open the tests source file which is located in the `tests` directory
and remove the `#[ignore]` flag from the next test and get the tests to pass
again. Each separate test is a function with `#[test]` flag above it.
Continue, until you pass every test.

If you wish to run all ignored tests without editing the tests source file, use:

```bash
$ cargo test -- --ignored
```

To run a specific test, for example `some_test`, you can use:

```bash
$ cargo test some_test
```

If the specific test is ignored use:

```bash
$ cargo test some_test -- --ignored
```

To learn more about Rust tests refer to the [online test documentation][rust-tests]

Make sure to read the [Modules][modules] chapter if you
haven't already, it will help you with organizing your files.

## Further improvements

After you have solved the exercise, please consider using the additional utilities, described in the [installation guide](https://exercism.io/tracks/rust/installation), to further refine your final solution.

To format your solution, inside the solution directory use

```bash
cargo fmt
```

To see, if your solution contains some common ineffective use cases, inside the solution directory use

```bash
cargo clippy --all-targets
```

## Submitting the solution

Generally you should submit all files in which you implemented your solution (`src/lib.rs` in most cases). If you are using any external crates, please consider submitting the `Cargo.toml` file. This will make the review process faster and clearer.
