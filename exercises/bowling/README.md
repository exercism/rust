# Bowling

Score a bowling game.

Bowling is game where players roll a heavy ball to knock down pins
arranged in a triangle. Write code to keep track of the score
of a game of bowling.

## Scoring Bowling

The game consists of 10 frames. A frame is composed of one or two ball throws with 10 pins standing at frame initialization. There are three cases for the tabulation of a frame.

* An open frame is where a score of less than 10 is recorded for the frame. In this case the score for the frame is the number of pins knocked down.

* A spare is where all ten pins are knocked down after the second throw. The total value of a spare is 10 plus the number of pins knocked down in their next throw.

* A strike is where all ten pins are knocked down after the first throw. The total value of a strike is 10 plus the number of pins knocked down in their next two throws. If a strike is immediately followed by a second strike, then we can not total the value of first strike until they throw the ball one more time.

Here is a three frame example:

| Frame 1         | Frame 2       | Frame 3                |
| :-------------: |:-------------:| :---------------------:|
| X (strike)      | 5/ (spare)    | 9 0 (open frame)       |

Frame 1 is (10 + 5 + 5) = 20

Frame 2 is (5 + 5 + 9) = 19

Frame 3 is (9 + 0) = 9

This means the current running total is 48.

The tenth frame in the game is a special case. If someone throws a strike or a spare then they get a fill ball. Fill balls exist to calculate the total of the 10th frame. Scoring a strike or spare on the fill ball does not give the player more fill balls. The total value of the 10th frame is the total number of pins knocked down.

For a tenth frame of X1/ (strike and a spare), the total value is 20.

For a tenth frame of XXX (three strikes), the total value is 30.

## Requirements

Write code to keep track of the score of a game of bowling. It should
support two operations:

* `roll(pins : int)` is called each time the player rolls a ball.  The
  argument is the number of pins knocked down.
* `score() : int` is called only at the very end of the game.  It
  returns the total score for that game.

## Rust Installation

Refer to the [exercism help page][help-page] for Rust installation and learning
resources.

## Writing the Code

Execute the tests with:

```bash
$ cargo test
```

All but the first test have been ignored.  After you get the first test to
pass, remove the ignore flag (`#[ignore]`) from the next test and get the tests
to pass again.  The test file is located in the `tests` directory.   You can
also remove the ignore flag from all the tests to get them to run all at once
if you wish.

Make sure to read the [Crates and Modules](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/crates-and-modules.html) chapter if you
haven't already, it will help you with organizing your files.
