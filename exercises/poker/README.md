# Poker

Pick the best hand(s) from a list of poker hands.

See [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_poker_hands) for an
overview of poker hands.

## Hints

- Ranking a list of poker hands can be considered a sorting problem.
- Rust provides the [sort](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/vec/struct.Vec.html#method.sort) method for `Vec<T> where T: Ord`.
- [`Ord` types](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/cmp/trait.Ord.html) form a [total order](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_order): exactly one of `a < b`, `a == b`, or `a > b` must be true.
- Poker hands do not conform to a total order: it is possible for two hands to be non-equal but have equal sort order. Example: `"3S 4S 5D 6H JH"`, `"3H 4H 5C 6C JD"`.
- Rust provides the [`PartialOrd` trait](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/cmp/trait.PartialOrd.html) to handle the case of sortable things which do not have a total order. However, it doesn't provide a standard `sort` method for `Vec<T> where T: PartialOrd`. The standard idiom to sort a vector in this case is `your_vec.sort_by(|a, b| a.partial_cmp(b).unwrap_or(Ordering::{Less|Equal|Greater}));`, depending on your needs.
- You might consider implementing a type representing a poker hand which implements `PartialOrd`.


## Rust Installation

Refer to the [exercism help page][help-page] for Rust installation and learning
resources.

## Writing the Code

Execute the tests with:

```bash
$ cargo test
```

All but the first test have been ignored. After you get the first test to
pass, open the tests source file which is located in the `tests` directory
and remove the `#[ignore]` flag from the next test and get the tests to pass
again. Each separate test is a function with `#[test]` flag above it.
Continue, until you pass every test.

If you wish to run all ignored tests without editing the tests source file, use:

```bash
$ cargo test -- --ignored
```

To run a specific test, for example `some_test`, you can use:

```bash
$ cargo test some_test
```

If the specific test is ignored use:

```bash
$ cargo test some_test -- --ignored
```

To learn more about Rust tests refer to the [online test documentation][rust-tests]

Make sure to read the [Modules][modules] chapter if you
haven't already, it will help you with organizing your files.

## Further improvements

After you have solved the exercise, please consider using the additional utilities, described in the [installation guide](https://exercism.io/tracks/rust/installation), to further refine your final solution.

To format your solution, inside the solution directory use

```bash
cargo fmt
```

To see, if your solution contains some common ineffective use cases, inside the solution directory use

```bash
cargo clippy --all-targets
```

## Submitting the solution

Generally you should submit all files in which you implemented your solution (`src/lib.rs` in most cases). If you are using any external crates, please consider submitting the `Cargo.toml` file. This will make the review process faster and clearer.
