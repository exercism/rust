# Affine Cipher

Create an implementation of the affine cipher,
an ancient encryption system created in the Middle East.

The affine cipher is a type of monoalphabetic substitution cipher.
Each character is mapped to its numeric equivalent, encrypted with
a mathematical function and then converted to the letter relating to
its new numeric value. Although all monoalphabetic ciphers are weak,
the affine cypher is much stronger than the atbash cipher,
because it has many more keys.

the encryption function is:

  `E(x) = (ax + b) mod m`
  -  where `x` is the letter's index from 0 - length of alphabet - 1
  -  `m` is the length of the alphabet. For the roman alphabet `m == 26`.
  -  and `a` and `b` make the key

the decryption function is:

  `D(y) = a^-1(y - b) mod m`
  -  where `y` is the numeric value of an encrypted letter, ie. `y = E(x)`
  -  it is important to note that `a^-1` is the modular multiplicative inverse
     of `a mod m`
  -  the modular multiplicative inverse of `a` only exists if `a` and `m` are
     coprime.

To find the MMI of `a`:

  `an mod m = 1`
  -  where `n` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `a mod m`

More information regarding how to find a Modular Multiplicative Inverse
and what it means can be found [here.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modular_multiplicative_inverse)

Because automatic decryption fails if `a` is not coprime to `m` your
program should return status 1 and `"Error: a and m must be coprime."`
if they are not.  Otherwise it should encode or decode with the
provided key.

The Caesar (shift) cipher is a simple affine cipher where `a` is 1 and
`b` as the magnitude results in a static displacement of the letters.
This is much less secure than a full implementation of the affine cipher.

Ciphertext is written out in groups of fixed length, the traditional group
size being 5 letters, and punctuation is excluded. This is to make it
harder to guess things based on word boundaries.

## Examples

 - Encoding `test` gives `ybty` with the key a=5 b=7
 - Decoding `ybty` gives `test` with the key a=5 b=7
 - Decoding `ybty` gives `lqul` with the wrong key a=11 b=7
 - Decoding `kqlfd jzvgy tpaet icdhm rtwly kqlon ubstx`
   - gives `thequickbrownfoxjumpsoverthelazydog` with the key a=19 b=13
 - Encoding `test` with the key a=18 b=13
   - gives `Error: a and m must be coprime.`
   - because a and m are not relatively prime

### Examples of finding a Modular Multiplicative Inverse (MMI)

  - simple example:
    - `9 mod 26 = 9`
    - `9 * 3 mod 26 = 27 mod 26 = 1`
    - `3` is the MMI of `9 mod 26`
  - a more complicated example:
    - `15 mod 26 = 15`
    - `15 * 7 mod 26 = 105 mod 26 = 1`
    - `7` is the MMI of `15 mod 26`

## Rust Installation

Refer to the [exercism help page][help-page] for Rust installation and learning
resources.

## Writing the Code

Execute the tests with:

```bash
$ cargo test
```

All but the first test have been ignored. After you get the first test to
pass, open the tests source file which is located in the `tests` directory
and remove the `#[ignore]` flag from the next test and get the tests to pass
again. Each separate test is a function with `#[test]` flag above it.
Continue, until you pass every test.

If you wish to run all ignored tests without editing the tests source file, use:

```bash
$ cargo test -- --ignored
```

To run a specific test, for example `some_test`, you can use:

```bash
$ cargo test some_test
```

If the specific test is ignored use:

```bash
$ cargo test some_test -- --ignored
```

To learn more about Rust tests refer to the [online test documentation][rust-tests]

Make sure to read the [Modules][modules] chapter if you
haven't already, it will help you with organizing your files.

## Further improvements

After you have solved the exercise, please consider using the additional utilities, described in the [installation guide](https://exercism.io/tracks/rust/installation), to further refine your final solution.

To format your solution, inside the solution directory use

```bash
cargo fmt
```

To see, if your solution contains some common ineffective use cases, inside the solution directory use

```bash
cargo clippy --all-targets
```

## Submitting the solution

Generally you should submit all files in which you implemented your solution (`src/lib.rs` in most cases). If you are using any external crates, please consider submitting the `Cargo.toml` file. This will make the review process faster and clearer.
