# Grains

Calculate the number of grains of wheat on a chessboard given that the number
on each square doubles.

There once was a wise servant who saved the life of a prince. The king
promised to pay whatever the servant could dream up. Knowing that the
king loved chess, the servant told the king he would like to have grains
of wheat. One grain on the first square of a chess board, with the number
of grains doubling on each successive square.

There are 64 squares on a chessboard (where square 1 has one grain, square 2 has two grains, and so on).

Write code that shows:
- how many grains were on a given square, and
- the total number of grains on the chessboard

## For bonus points

Did you get the tests passing and the code clean? If you want to, these
are some additional things you could try:

- Optimize for speed.
- Optimize for readability.

Then please share your thoughts in a comment on the submission. Did this
experiment make the code better? Worse? Did you learn anything from it?

## Rust Installation

Refer to the [exercism help page][help-page] for Rust installation and learning
resources.

## Writing the Code

Execute the tests with:

```bash
$ cargo test
```

All but the first test have been ignored. After you get the first test to
pass, open the tests source file which is located in the `tests` directory
and remove the `#[ignore]` flag from the next test and get the tests to pass
again. Each separate test is a function with `#[test]` flag above it.
Continue, until you pass every test.

If you wish to run all ignored tests without editing the tests source file, use:

```bash
$ cargo test -- --ignored
```

To run a specific test, for example `some_test`, you can use:

```bash
$ cargo test some_test
```

If the specific test is ignored use:

```bash
$ cargo test some_test -- --ignored
```

To learn more about Rust tests refer to the [online test documentation][rust-tests]

Make sure to read the [Modules][modules] chapter if you
haven't already, it will help you with organizing your files.

## Further improvements

After you have solved the exercise, please consider using the additional utilities, described in the [installation guide](https://exercism.io/tracks/rust/installation), to further refine your final solution.

To format your solution, inside the solution directory use

```bash
cargo fmt
```

To see, if your solution contains some common ineffective use cases, inside the solution directory use

```bash
cargo clippy --all-targets
```

## Submitting the solution

Generally you should submit all files in which you implemented your solution (`src/lib.rs` in most cases). If you are using any external crates, please consider submitting the `Cargo.toml` file. This will make the review process faster and clearer.
