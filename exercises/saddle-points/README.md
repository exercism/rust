# Saddle Points

Detect saddle points in a matrix.

So say you have a matrix like so:

```text
    0  1  2
  |---------
0 | 9  8  7
1 | 5  3  2     <--- saddle point at (1,0)
2 | 6  6  7
```

It has a saddle point at (1, 0).

It's called a "saddle point" because it is greater than or equal to
every element in its row and less than or equal to every element in
its column.

A matrix may have zero or more saddle points.

Your code should be able to provide the (possibly empty) list of all the
saddle points for any given matrix.

Note that you may find other definitions of matrix saddle points online,
but the tests for this exercise follow the above unambiguous definition.

## Rust Installation

Refer to the [exercism help page][help-page] for Rust installation and learning
resources.

## Writing the Code

Execute the tests with:

```bash
$ cargo test
```

All but the first test have been ignored.  After you get the first test to
pass, remove the ignore flag (`#[ignore]`) from the next test and get the tests
to pass again.  The test file is located in the `tests` directory.   You can
also remove the ignore flag from all the tests to get them to run all at once
if you wish.

Make sure to read the [Modules](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/second-edition/ch07-00-modules.html) chapter if you
haven't already, it will help you with organizing your files.
