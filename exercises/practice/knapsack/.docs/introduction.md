# Introduction

Bob is a thief.
After months of careful planning, he finally manages to crack the security systems of a fancy store.

In front of him are many items, each with a value and weight.
Bob would gladly take all of the items, but his knapsack can only hold so much weight.
Bob has to carefully consider which items to take so that the total value of his selection is maximized.
