# Instructions

Implement a clock that handles times without dates.

You should be able to add and subtract minutes to it.

Two clocks that represent the same time should be equal to each other.

You will also need to impliment `.to_string()` for the `Clock` struct. We will be using this to display the Clock's data.  You can either do it via implimenting  `String::from` or using the [Display trait](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/fmt/trait.Display.html).

You might also want to add extra attributes like `#[derive(Debug, PartialEq)]` during testing.

Enjoy!
