# Introduction

A leap year (in the Gregorian calendar) occurs:

- In every year that is evenly divisible by 4
- Unless the year is evenly divisible by 100, in which case it's only a leap year if the year is also evenly divisible by 400.

Some examples:

- 1997 was not a leap year as it's not divisible by 4.
- 1900 was not a leap year as it's not divisible by 400
- 2000 was a leap year!
