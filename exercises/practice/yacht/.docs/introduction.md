# Introduction

Each year, something new is "all the rage" in your high school.
This year it is a dice game: [Yacht][yacht].

The game of Yacht is from the same family as Poker Dice, Generala and particularly Yahtzee, of which it is a precursor.
The game consists of twelve rounds.
In each, five dice are rolled and the player chooses one of twelve categories.
The chosen category is then used to score the throw of the dice.
