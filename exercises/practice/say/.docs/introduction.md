# Introduction

Your friend Yaʻqūb works the counter at the busiest deli in town, slicing, weighing, and wrapping orders for a never-ending line of hungry customers.
To keep things moving, each customer takes a numbered ticket when they arrive.

When it’s time to call the next person, Yaʻqūb reads their number out loud, always in full English words to make sure everyone hears it clearly.
