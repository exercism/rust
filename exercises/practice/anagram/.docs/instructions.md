# Instructions

Given a target word and one or more candidate words, your task is to find the candidates that are anagrams of the target.

An anagram is a rearrangement of letters to form a new word: for example `"owns"` is an anagram of `"snow"`.
A word is _not_ its own anagram: for example, `"stop"` is not an anagram of `"stop"`.

The target word and candidate words are made up of one or more ASCII alphabetic characters (`A`-`Z` and `a`-`z`).
Lowercase and uppercase characters are equivalent: for example, `"PoTS"` is an anagram of `"sTOp"`, but `"StoP"` is not an anagram of `"sTOp"`.
The words you need to find should be taken from the candidate words, using the same letter case.

Given the target `"stone"` and the candidate words `"stone"`, `"tones"`, `"banana"`, `"tons"`, `"notes"`, and `"Seton"`, the anagram words you need to find are `"tones"`, `"notes"`, and `"Seton"`.
