# Introduction

At a garage sale, you find a lovely vintage typewriter at a bargain price!
Excitedly, you rush home, insert a sheet of paper, and start typing away.
However, your excitement wanes when you examine the output: all words are garbled!
For example, it prints "stop" instead of "post" and "least" instead of "stale."
Carefully, you try again, but now it prints "spot" and "slate."
After some experimentation, you find there is a random delay before each letter is printed, which messes up the order.
You now understand why they sold it for so little money!

You realize this quirk allows you to generate anagrams, which are words formed by rearranging the letters of another word.
Pleased with your finding, you spend the rest of the day generating hundreds of anagrams.
