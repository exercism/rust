## Implementing your own list operations

Rust has a rich iterator system, using them to solve this exercise is trivial.
Please attempt to solve the exercise without reaching for iterator methods like 
`map()`, `flatten()`, `filter()`, `count()`, `fold()`, `chain()`, `rev()` and similar.
The `next()` and `next_back()` methods do not count.

## Avoiding allocations

The exercise is solvable without introducing any additional memory allocations in the solution.
See if you can create your own iterator type instead of creating an iterator from a collection.
