# Introduction

There are many ways to implement Sieve.
One approach can use a couple of  [`Range`][range]s to iterate the indexes of the `Vec`, both outside and inside a [`filter_map()`][filtermap] method,
to process the numbers.
Another approach could use a couple of [for in range][for-in-range] loops to iterate and process the numbers,
and then use the [`filter()`][filter] method to return the `Vec`.

## General guidance

One of the things to try to minimize is [mutability][mutability].
If using `mut` for anything than the `Vec`, then the solution may use more mutability than required.

## Approach: `Range`s and `filter-map()`

```rust
pub fn primes_up_to(upper_bound: u64) -> Vec<u64> {
    let mut numbers: Vec<_> = (0..=upper_bound).map(Option::from).collect();
    let upper_bound = upper_bound as usize;
    (2..numbers.len())
        .filter_map(|i| {
            let prime = numbers[i].take()? as usize;
            (prime + prime..=upper_bound)
                .step_by(prime)
                .for_each(|j| numbers[j] = None);
            Some(prime as u64)
        })
        .collect()
}
```

## Approach: `for` in ranges with `filter()`

```rust
pub fn primes_up_to(upper_bound: u64) -> Vec<u64> {
    let mut work: Vec<u64> = (0..=upper_bound).collect();
    work[1] = 0;
    let stop = (upper_bound as f64).sqrt() as usize + 1usize;
    let upper_bound = upper_bound as usize;
    for i in 2..stop {
        if (work[i]) != 0 {
            for idx in (i * i..=upper_bound).step_by(i) {
                work[idx] = 0;
            }
        }
    }
    work.iter().filter(|num| *num != &0u64).copied().collect()
}
```

## Which approach to use?

The `filter_map` approach may be considered more idiomatic.
Using the following benchmark, the `filter_map()` approach was also faster.

```rust
#[bench]
fn limit_of_1000(b: &mut Bencher) {
    b.iter(|| primes_up_to(1000));
}
```

Results

```
// range and filter_map
test limit_of_1000 ... bench:       5,164 ns/iter (+/- 206)

// for in ranges with filter
test limit_of_1000 ... bench:       5,945 ns/iter (+/- 310)
```
