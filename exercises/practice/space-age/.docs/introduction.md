# Introduction

The year is 2525 and you've just embarked on a journey to visit all planets in the Solar System (Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune).
The first stop is Mercury, where customs require you to fill out a form (bureaucracy is apparently _not_ Earth-specific).
As you hand over the form to the customs officer, they scrutinize it and frown.
"Do you _really_ expect me to believe you're just 50 years old?
You must be closer to 200 years old!"

Amused, you wait for the customs officer to start laughing, but they appear to be dead serious.
You realize that you've entered your age in _Earth years_, but the officer expected it in _Mercury years_!
As Mercury's orbital period around the sun is significantly shorter than Earth, you're actually a lot older in Mercury years.
After some quick calculations, you're able to provide your age in Mercury Years.
The customs officer smiles, satisfied, and waves you through.
You make a mental note to pre-calculate your planet-specific age _before_ future customs checks, to avoid such mix-ups.
