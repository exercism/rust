# Topics

Some Rust topics you may want to read about while solving this problem:

- Traits, both the From trait and implementing your own traits
- Default method implementations for traits
- Macros, the use of a macro could reduce boilerplate and increase readability 
  for this exercise. For instance, 
  [a macro can implement a trait for multiple types at once](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/39150216/implementing-a-trait-for-multiple-types-at-once),
  though it is fine to implement `years_during` in the Planet trait itself. A macro could
  define both the structs and their implementations. Info to get started with macros can 
  be found at:
  
  - [The Macros chapter in The Rust Programming Language](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/ch19-06-macros.html)
  - [an older version of the Macros chapter with helpful detail](https://doc.rust-lang.org/1.30.0/book/first-edition/macros.html)
  - [Rust By Example](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/rust-by-example/macros.html)
