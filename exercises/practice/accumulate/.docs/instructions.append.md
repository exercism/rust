# Hints

It may help to look at the Fn\* traits:
[Fn](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/ops/trait.Fn.html),
[FnMut](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/ops/trait.FnMut.html) and
[FnOnce](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/ops/trait.FnOnce.html).

Help with passing a closure into a function may be found in
the ["closures as input parameters" section](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/rust-by-example/fn/closures/input_parameters.html) of
[Rust by Example](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/rust-by-example/).

The tests for this exercise will cause compile time errors,
if your function signature does not fit them, even when they're not run.
You may want to comment some tests out and generalize your solution piece by piece.
