# Builder pattern

This exercise expects you to build several structs using `builder pattern`.
In short, this pattern allows you to split the construction function of your struct, that contains a lot of arguments, into 
several separate functions. This approach gives you the means to make compact but highly-flexible struct construction and
configuration.
You can read more about it on the [following page](https://doc.rust-lang.org/1.0.0/style/ownership/builders.html).
