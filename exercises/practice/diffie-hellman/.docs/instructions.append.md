# Instructions append

One possible solution for this exercise is to implement your own modular exponentiation function.
To learn more about it refer to the [following page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modular_exponentiation).

## For bonus points

Many implementations do not work for the entire domain of inputs.
There are additional optional tests defined which help ensure that all valid inputs produce valid results.

To run the bonus tests, remove the `#[ignore]` flag and execute the tests with
the `big-primes` feature, like this:

```bash
$ cargo test --features big-primes
```
