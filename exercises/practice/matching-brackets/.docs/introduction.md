# Introduction

You're given the opportunity to write software for the Bracketeer™, an ancient but powerful mainframe.
The software that runs on it is written in a proprietary language.
Much of its syntax is familiar, but you notice _lots_ of brackets, braces and parentheses.
Despite the Bracketeer™ being powerful, it lacks flexibility.
If the source code has any unbalanced brackets, braces or parentheses, the Bracketeer™ crashes and must be rebooted.
To avoid such a scenario, you start writing code that can verify that brackets, braces, and parentheses are balanced before attempting to run it on the Bracketeer™.
