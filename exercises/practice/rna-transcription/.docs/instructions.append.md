# Notes on Rust implementation

By using private fields in structs with public `new` functions returning
`Option` or `Result` (as here with `DNA::new` & `RNA::new`), we can guarantee
that the internal representation of `DNA` is correct. Because every valid DNA
string has a valid RNA string, we don't need to return a `Result`/`Option` from
`into_rna`.

This explains the type signatures you will see in the tests.
