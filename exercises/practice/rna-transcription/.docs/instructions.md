# Instructions

Your task is to determine the RNA complement of a given DNA sequence.

Both DNA and RNA strands are a sequence of nucleotides.

The four nucleotides found in DNA are adenine (**A**), cytosine (**C**), guanine (**G**), and thymine (**T**).

The four nucleotides found in RNA are adenine (**A**), cytosine (**C**), guanine (**G**), and uracil (**U**).

Given a DNA strand, its transcribed RNA strand is formed by replacing each nucleotide with its complement:

- `G` -> `C`
- `C` -> `G`
- `T` -> `A`
- `A` -> `U`
