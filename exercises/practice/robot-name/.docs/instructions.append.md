## Global Mutable State

The way the tests are setup, you will be forced to use global mutable state.
This is generally frowned-upon and considered unidiomatic in Rust.
However, it's a delibarate choice for the purpose of learning here.

Can you think of a better API design that doesn't use global mutable state?
