# Instructions

Your task is to determine what Bob will reply to someone when they say something to him or ask him a question.

Bob only ever answers one of five things:

- **"Sure."**
  This is his response if you ask him a question, such as "How are you?"
  The convention used for questions is that it ends with a question mark.
- **"Whoa, chill out!"**
  This is his answer if you YELL AT HIM.
  The convention used for yelling is ALL CAPITAL LETTERS.
- **"Calm down, I know what I'm doing!"**
  This is what he says if you yell a question at him.
- **"Fine. Be that way!"**
  This is how he responds to silence.
  The convention used for silence is nothing, or various combinations of whitespace characters.
- **"Whatever."**
  This is what he answers to anything else.
