What do you expect the result to be if the length of the substrings is zero?
There is no one right answer, but we expect you to output a number of empty strings:
one more than the length of the input string.
While not intuitive to everyone, this upholds the property that the number of substrings is one more than the length of the input string minus the length of the substrings.
