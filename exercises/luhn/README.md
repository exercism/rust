# Luhn

Given a number determine whether or not it is valid per the Luhn formula.

The [Luhn algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luhn_algorithm) is
a simple checksum formula used to validate a variety of identification
numbers, such as credit card numbers and Canadian Social Insurance
Numbers.

The task is to check if a given string is valid.

Validating a Number
------

Strings of length 1 or less are not valid. Spaces are allowed in the input,
but they should be stripped before checking. All other non-digit characters
are disallowed.

## Example 1: valid credit card number

```text
4539 1488 0343 6467
```

The first step of the Luhn algorithm is to double every second digit,
starting from the right. We will be doubling

```text
4_3_ 1_8_ 0_4_ 6_6_
```

If doubling the number results in a number greater than 9 then subtract 9
from the product. The results of our doubling:

```text
8569 2478 0383 3437
```

Then sum all of the digits:

```text
8+5+6+9+2+4+7+8+0+3+8+3+3+4+3+7 = 80
```

If the sum is evenly divisible by 10, then the number is valid. This number is valid!

## Example 2: invalid credit card number

```text
8273 1232 7352 0569
```

Double the second digits, starting from the right

```text
7253 2262 5312 0539
```

Sum the digits

```text
7+2+5+3+2+2+6+2+5+3+1+2+0+5+3+9 = 57
```

57 is not evenly divisible by 10, so this number is not valid.

## Rust Installation

Refer to the [exercism help page][help-page] for Rust installation and learning
resources.

## Writing the Code

Execute the tests with:

```bash
$ cargo test
```

All but the first test have been ignored. After you get the first test to
pass, open the tests source file which is located in the `tests` directory
and remove the `#[ignore]` flag from the next test and get the tests to pass
again. Each separate test is a function with `#[test]` flag above it.
Continue, until you pass every test.

If you wish to run all tests without editing the tests source file, use:

```bash
$ cargo test -- --ignored
```

To run a specific test, for example `some_test`, you can use:

```bash
$ cargo test some_test
```

If the specific test is ignored use:

```bash
$ cargo test some_test -- --ignored
```

To learn more about Rust tests refer to the [online test documentation][rust-tests]

Make sure to read the [Modules](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch07-02-modules-and-use-to-control-scope-and-privacy.html) chapter if you
haven't already, it will help you with organizing your files.

## Further improvements

After you have solved the exercise, please consider using the additional utilities, described in the [installation guide](https://exercism.io/tracks/rust/installation), to further refine your final solution.

To format your solution, inside the solution directory use

```bash
cargo fmt
```

To see, if your solution contains some common ineffective use cases, inside the solution directory use

```bash
cargo clippy --all-targets
```

## Submitting the solution

Generally you should submit all files in which you implemented your solution (`src/lib.rs` in most cases). If you are using any external crates, please consider submitting the `Cargo.toml` file. This will make the review process faster and clearer.
