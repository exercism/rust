# Dominoes

Make a chain of dominoes.

Compute a way to order a given set of dominoes in such a way that they form a
correct domino chain (the dots on one half of a stone match the dots on the
neighbouring half of an adjacent stone) and that dots on the halves of the
stones which don't have a neighbour (the first and last stone) match each other.

For example given the stones `[2|1]`, `[2|3]` and `[1|3]` you should compute something
like `[1|2] [2|3] [3|1]` or `[3|2] [2|1] [1|3]` or `[1|3] [3|2] [2|1]` etc, where the first and last numbers are the same.

For stones `[1|2]`, `[4|1]` and `[2|3]` the resulting chain is not valid: `[4|1] [1|2] [2|3]`'s first and last numbers are not the same. 4 != 3

Some test cases may use duplicate stones in a chain solution, assume that multiple Domino sets are being used.

## Rust Installation

Refer to the [exercism help page][help-page] for Rust installation and learning
resources.

## Writing the Code

Execute the tests with:

```bash
$ cargo test
```

All but the first test have been ignored. After you get the first test to
pass, open the tests source file which is located in the `tests` directory
and remove the `#[ignore]` flag from the next test and get the tests to pass
again. Each separate test is a function with `#[test]` flag above it.
Continue, until you pass every test.

If you wish to run all ignored tests without editing the tests source file, use:

```bash
$ cargo test -- --ignored
```

To run a specific test, for example `some_test`, you can use:

```bash
$ cargo test some_test
```

If the specific test is ignored use:

```bash
$ cargo test some_test -- --ignored
```

To learn more about Rust tests refer to the [online test documentation][rust-tests]

Make sure to read the [Modules][modules] chapter if you
haven't already, it will help you with organizing your files.

## Further improvements

After you have solved the exercise, please consider using the additional utilities, described in the [installation guide](https://exercism.io/tracks/rust/installation), to further refine your final solution.

To format your solution, inside the solution directory use

```bash
cargo fmt
```

To see, if your solution contains some common ineffective use cases, inside the solution directory use

```bash
cargo clippy --all-targets
```

## Submitting the solution

Generally you should submit all files in which you implemented your solution (`src/lib.rs` in most cases). If you are using any external crates, please consider submitting the `Cargo.toml` file. This will make the review process faster and clearer.
