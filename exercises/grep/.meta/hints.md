### Error handling
This exercise introduces the usage of `failure` crate,
that gives you the means to manage your custom error types.
To learn more about the crate refer to the [failure documentation](https://boats.gitlab.io/failure/intro.html)

### Additional reading

While this exercise asks you to implement only the most basic functions of `grep`,
there is acually a project to fully re-implement `grep` in Rust - [ripgrep](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep).

If you liked the concept of rewriting the basic util programms in Rust be sure to check the following projects:
- [fd](https://github.com/sharkdp/fd) - a clone of `find`
- [exa](https://github.com/ogham/exa) - a clone of `ls`
- [bat](https://github.com/sharkdp/bat) - a clone of `cat`
- [coreutils](https://github.com/uutils/coreutils) - a rewrite of the GNU coreutils
