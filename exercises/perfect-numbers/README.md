# Perfect Numbers

Determine if a number is perfect, abundant, or deficient based on
Nicomachus' (60 - 120 CE) classification scheme for natural numbers.

The Greek mathematician [Nicomachus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicomachus) devised a classification scheme for natural numbers, identifying each as belonging uniquely to the categories of **perfect**, **abundant**, or **deficient** based on their [aliquot sum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aliquot_sum). The aliquot sum is defined as the sum of the factors of a number not including the number itself. For example, the aliquot sum of 15 is (1 + 3 + 5) = 9

- **Perfect**: aliquot sum = number 
  - 6 is a perfect number because (1 + 2 + 3) = 6
  - 28 is a perfect number because (1 + 2 + 4 + 7 + 14) = 28
- **Abundant**: aliquot sum > number
  - 12 is an abundant number because (1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 6) = 16
  - 24 is an abundant number because (1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 6 + 8 + 12) = 36
- **Deficient**: aliquot sum < number
  - 8 is a deficient number because (1 + 2 + 4) = 7
  - Prime numbers are deficient
  
Implement a way to determine whether a given number is **perfect**. Depending on your language track, you may also need to implement a way to determine whether a given number is **abundant** or **deficient**.

## Rust Installation

Refer to the [exercism help page][help-page] for Rust installation and learning
resources.

## Writing the Code

Execute the tests with:

```bash
$ cargo test
```

All but the first test have been ignored.  After you get the first test to
pass, remove the ignore flag (`#[ignore]`) from the next test and get the tests
to pass again.  The test file is located in the `tests` directory.   You can
also remove the ignore flag from all the tests to get them to run all at once
if you wish.

Make sure to read the [Crates and Modules](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/crates-and-modules.html) chapter if you
haven't already, it will help you with organizing your files.
