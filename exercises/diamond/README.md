# Diamond

The diamond kata takes as its input a letter, and outputs it in a diamond
shape. Given a letter, it prints a diamond starting with 'A', with the
supplied letter at the widest point.

## Requirements

* The first row contains one 'A'.
* The last row contains one 'A'.
* All rows, except the first and last, have exactly two identical letters.
* All rows have as many trailing spaces as leading spaces. (This might be 0).
* The diamond is horizontally symmetric.
* The diamond is vertically symmetric.
* The diamond has a square shape (width equals height).
* The letters form a diamond shape.
* The top half has the letters in ascending order.
* The bottom half has the letters in descending order.
* The four corners (containing the spaces) are triangles.

## Examples

In the following examples, spaces are indicated by `·` characters.

Diamond for letter 'A':

```text
A
```

Diamond for letter 'C':

```text
··A··
·B·B·
C···C
·B·B·
··A··
```

Diamond for letter 'E':

```text
····A····
···B·B···
··C···C··
·D·····D·
E·······E
·D·····D·
··C···C··
···B·B···
····A····
```

## Rust Installation

Refer to the [exercism help page][help-page] for Rust installation and learning
resources.

## Writing the Code

Execute the tests with:

```bash
$ cargo test
```

All but the first test have been ignored.  After you get the first test to
pass, remove the ignore flag (`#[ignore]`) from the next test and get the tests
to pass again.  The test file is located in the `tests` directory.   You can
also remove the ignore flag from all the tests to get them to run all at once
if you wish.

Make sure to read the [Modules](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/second-edition/ch07-00-modules.html) chapter if you
haven't already, it will help you with organizing your files.
