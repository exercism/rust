# Diamond

The diamond kata takes as its input a letter, and outputs it in a diamond
shape. Given a letter, it prints a diamond starting with 'A', with the
supplied letter at the widest point.

## Requirements

* The first row contains one 'A'.
* The last row contains one 'A'.
* All rows, except the first and last, have exactly two identical letters.
* All rows have as many trailing spaces as leading spaces. (This might be 0).
* The diamond is horizontally symmetric.
* The diamond is vertically symmetric.
* The diamond has a square shape (width equals height).
* The letters form a diamond shape.
* The top half has the letters in ascending order.
* The bottom half has the letters in descending order.
* The four corners (containing the spaces) are triangles.

## Examples

In the following examples, spaces are indicated by `·` characters.

Diamond for letter 'A':

```text
A
```

Diamond for letter 'C':

```text
··A··
·B·B·
C···C
·B·B·
··A··
```

Diamond for letter 'E':

```text
····A····
···B·B···
··C···C··
·D·····D·
E·······E
·D·····D·
··C···C··
···B·B···
····A····
```

## Rust Installation

Refer to the [exercism help page][help-page] for Rust installation and learning
resources.

## Writing the Code

Execute the tests with:

```bash
$ cargo test
```

All but the first test have been ignored. After you get the first test to
pass, open the tests source file which is located in the `tests` directory
and remove the `#[ignore]` flag from the next test and get the tests to pass
again. Each separate test is a function with `#[test]` flag above it.
Continue, until you pass every test.

If you wish to run all ignored tests without editing the tests source file, use:

```bash
$ cargo test -- --ignored
```

To run a specific test, for example `some_test`, you can use:

```bash
$ cargo test some_test
```

If the specific test is ignored use:

```bash
$ cargo test some_test -- --ignored
```

To learn more about Rust tests refer to the [online test documentation][rust-tests]

Make sure to read the [Modules][modules] chapter if you
haven't already, it will help you with organizing your files.

## Further improvements

After you have solved the exercise, please consider using the additional utilities, described in the [installation guide](https://exercism.io/tracks/rust/installation), to further refine your final solution.

To format your solution, inside the solution directory use

```bash
cargo fmt
```

To see, if your solution contains some common ineffective use cases, inside the solution directory use

```bash
cargo clippy --all-targets
```

## Submitting the solution

Generally you should submit all files in which you implemented your solution (`src/lib.rs` in most cases). If you are using any external crates, please consider submitting the `Cargo.toml` file. This will make the review process faster and clearer.
