# Nucleotide Count

Given a single stranded DNA string, compute how many times each nucleotide occurs in the string.

The genetic language of every living thing on the planet is DNA.
DNA is a large molecule that is built from an extremely long sequence of individual elements called nucleotides.
4 types exist in DNA and these differ only slightly and can be represented as the following symbols: 'A' for adenine, 'C' for cytosine, 'G' for guanine, and 'T' thymine.

Here is an analogy:
- twigs are to birds nests as
- nucleotides are to DNA as
- legos are to lego houses as
- words are to sentences as...

## Rust Installation

Refer to the [exercism help page][help-page] for Rust installation and learning
resources.

## Writing the Code

Execute the tests with:

```bash
$ cargo test
```

All but the first test have been ignored. If you wish to run every possible test use:

```bash
$ cargo test -- --ignored
```

To run specific test, for example `some_test`, you can use:

```bash
$ cargo test some_test
```

To find test names, view the tests source file wich is located in `tests` directory.
Every function that contains `#[test]` flag above it's name is a separate test.
If the specfic test is ignored use:

```bash
$ cargo test some_test -- --ignored
```

Alternatively you can edit the tests source file and remove the `#[ignore]` flag
from the tests you wish to run and use the first `cargo test` command to run them.

Make sure to read the [Modules](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/second-edition/ch07-00-modules.html) chapter if you
haven't already, it will help you with organizing your files.
