# Accumulate

Implement the `accumulate` operation, which, given a collection and an
operation to perform on each element of the collection, returns a new
collection containing the result of applying that operation to each element of
the input collection.

Given the collection of numbers:

- 1, 2, 3, 4, 5

And the operation:

- square a number (`x => x * x`)

Your code should be able to produce the collection of squares:

- 1, 4, 9, 16, 25

Check out the test suite to see the expected function signature.

## Restrictions

Keep your hands off that collect/map/fmap/whatchamacallit functionality
provided by your standard library!
Solve this one yourself using other basic tools instead.

Lisp specific: it's perfectly fine to use `MAPCAR` or the equivalent,
as this is idiomatic Lisp, not a library function.

## Hints

We are dealing with two types of situations.  One is a function pointer and
the other is a closure.

It may help to look at the [Fn trait](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/ops/trait.Fn.html).

Help with passing a closure into a function may be found in
the ["closures as input parameters" section](https://rustbyexample.com/fn/closures/input_parameters.html) of
[Rust by Example](https://rustbyexample.com/).


## Rust Installation

Refer to the [exercism help page][help-page] for Rust installation and learning
resources.

## Writing the Code

Execute the tests with:

```bash
$ cargo test
```

All but the first test have been ignored.  After you get the first test to
pass, remove the ignore flag (`#[ignore]`) from the next test and get the tests
to pass again.  The test file is located in the `tests` directory.   You can
also remove the ignore flag from all the tests to get them to run all at once
if you wish.

Make sure to read the [Crates and Modules](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/crates-and-modules.html) chapter if you
haven't already, it will help you with organizing your files.
