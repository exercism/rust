## Hints

We are dealing with two types of situations.  One is a function pointer and
the other is a closure.

It may help to look at the [Fn trait](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/ops/trait.Fn.html).

Help with passing a closure into a function may be found in
the ["closures as input parameters" section](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/rust-by-example/fn/closures/input_parameters.html) of
[Rust by Example](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/rust-by-example/).
