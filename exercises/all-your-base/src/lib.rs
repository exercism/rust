///
/// Convert a number between two bases.
///
/// A number is any slice of digits.
/// A digit is any signed integer (e.g. i8, i16, i32, or i64).
/// Bases are specified as signed integers.
///
/// Return an `Err(.)` if the conversion is impossible.
/// The tests do not test for specific values inside the `Err(.)`.
///
///
/// You are allowed to change the function signature as long as all test still pass.
///
///
/// Example:
/// Input
///   number: &[4, 2]
///   from_base: 10
///   to_base: 2
/// Result
///   Ok(vec![1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0])
///
/// The example corresponds to converting the number 42 from decimal
/// which is equivalent to 101010 in binary.
///
///
/// Notes:
///  * The empty slice ( "[]" ) is equal to the number 0.
///  * Never output leading 0 digits. However, your function must be able to
///     process input with leading 0 digits.
