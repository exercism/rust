# Proverb

For want of a horseshoe nail, a kingdom was lost, or so the saying goes. Output
the full text of this proverbial rhyme:

> For want of a nail the shoe was lost.  
> For want of a shoe the horse was lost.  
> For want of a horse the rider was lost.  
> For want of a rider the message was lost.  
> For want of a message the battle was lost.  
> For want of a battle the kingdom was lost.  
> And all for the want of a horseshoe nail.

## Rust Installation

Refer to the [exercism help page][help-page] for Rust installation and learning
resources.

## Writing the Code

Execute the tests with:

```bash
$ cargo test
```

All but the first test have been ignored.  After you get the first test to
pass, remove the ignore flag (`#[ignore]`) from the next test and get the tests
to pass again.  The test file is located in the `tests` directory.   You can
also remove the ignore flag from all the tests to get them to run all at once
if you wish.

Make sure to read the [Crates and Modules](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/crates-and-modules.html) chapter if you
haven't already, it will help you with organizing your files.
