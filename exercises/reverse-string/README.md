# Reverse String

Reverse a string

For example:
input: "cool"
output: "looc"

## Bonus
Test your function on this string: `uuÌˆu` and see what happens. Try to write a function that properly
reverses this string. Hint: grapheme clusters

To get the bonus test to run, remove the ignore flag (`#[ignore]`) from the
last test, and execute the tests with:

```bash
$ cargo test --features grapheme
```


## Rust Installation

Refer to the [exercism help page][help-page] for Rust installation and learning
resources.

## Writing the Code

Execute the tests with:

```bash
$ cargo test
```

All but the first test have been ignored. If you wish to run every possible test use:

```bash
$ cargo test -- --ignored
```

To run specific test, for example `some_test`, you can use:

```bash
$ cargo test some_test
```

To find test names, view the tests source file wich is located in `tests` directory.
Every function that contains `#[test]` flag above it's name is a separate test.
If the specfic test is ignored use:

```bash
$ cargo test some_test -- --ignored
```

Alternatively you can edit the tests source file and remove the `#[ignore]` flag
from the tests you wish to run and use the first `cargo test` command to run them.

Make sure to read the [Modules](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/second-edition/ch07-00-modules.html) chapter if you
haven't already, it will help you with organizing your files.
