# Grade School

Given students' names along with the grade that they are in, create a roster
for the school.

In the end, you should be able to:

- Add a student's name to the roster for a grade
  - "Add Jim to grade 2."
  - "OK."
- Get a list of all students enrolled in a grade
  - "Which students are in grade 2?"
  - "We've only got Jim just now."
- Get a sorted list of all students in all grades.  Grades should sort
  as 1, 2, 3, etc., and students within a grade should be sorted
  alphabetically by name.
  - "Who all is enrolled in school right now?"
  - "Grade 1: Anna, Barb, and Charlie. Grade 2: Alex, Peter, and Zoe.
    Grade 3â€¦"

Note that all our students only have one name.  (It's a small town, what
do you want?)

## For bonus points

Did you get the tests passing and the code clean? If you want to, these
are some additional things you could try:

- If you're working in a language with mutable data structures and your
  implementation allows outside code to mutate the school's internal DB
  directly, see if you can prevent this. Feel free to introduce additional
  tests.

Then please share your thoughts in a comment on the submission. Did this
experiment make the code better? Worse? Did you learn anything from it?

## Rust Installation

Refer to the [exercism help page][help-page] for Rust installation and learning
resources.

## Writing the Code

Execute the tests with:

```bash
$ cargo test
```

All but the first test have been ignored.  After you get the first test to
pass, remove the ignore flag (`#[ignore]`) from the next test and get the tests
to pass again.  The test file is located in the `tests` directory.   You can
also remove the ignore flag from all the tests to get them to run all at once
if you wish.

Make sure to read the [Modules](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/second-edition/ch07-00-modules.html) chapter if you
haven't already, it will help you with organizing your files.
