## Rust Traits for .to_string()

Did you implement .to_string() for the Clock struct?

If so, try implementing the
[Display trait](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/fmt/trait.Display.html) for Clock instead.

Traits allow for a common way to implement functionality for various types.

For additional learning, how would you implement String::from for the Clock type?
