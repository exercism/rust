# Clock

Implement a clock that handles times without dates.

You should be able to add and subtract minutes to it.

Two clocks that represent the same time should be equal to each other.

## Rust Traits for .to_string()

Did you implement .to_string() for the Clock struct?

If so, try implementing the
[Display trait](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/fmt/trait.Display.html) for Clock instead.

Traits allow for a common way to implement functionality for various types.

For additional learning, how would you implement String::from for the Clock type?


## Rust Installation

Refer to the [exercism help page][help-page] for Rust installation and learning
resources.

## Writing the Code

Execute the tests with:

```bash
$ cargo test
```

All but the first test have been ignored.  After you get the first test to
pass, remove the ignore flag (`#[ignore]`) from the next test and get the tests
to pass again.  The test file is located in the `tests` directory.   You can
also remove the ignore flag from all the tests to get them to run all at once
if you wish.

Make sure to read the [Modules](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/second-edition/ch07-00-modules.html) chapter if you
haven't already, it will help you with organizing your files.
