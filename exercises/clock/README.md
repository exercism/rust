# Clock

Implement a clock that handles times without dates.

You should be able to add and subtract minutes to it.

Two clocks that represent the same time should be equal to each other.

## Rust Traits for .to_string()

Did you implement .to_string() for the Clock struct?

If so, try implementing the
[Display trait](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/fmt/trait.Display.html) for Clock instead.

Traits allow for a common way to implement functionality for various types.

For additional learning, how would you implement String::from for the Clock type?


## Rust Installation

Refer to the [exercism help page][help-page] for Rust installation and learning
resources.

## Writing the Code

Execute the tests with:

```bash
$ cargo test
```

All but the first test have been ignored. If you wish to run every possible test use:

```bash
$ cargo test -- --ignored
```

To run specific test, for example `some_test`, you can use:

```bash
$ cargo test some_test
```

To find test names, view the tests source file wich is located in `tests` directory.
Every function that contains `#[test]` flag above it's name is a separate test.
If the specfic test is ignored use:

```bash
$ cargo test some_test -- --ignored
```

Alternatively you can edit the tests source file and remove the `#[ignore]` flag
from the tests you wish to run and use the first `cargo test` command to run them.

Make sure to read the [Modules](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/second-edition/ch07-00-modules.html) chapter if you
haven't already, it will help you with organizing your files.
