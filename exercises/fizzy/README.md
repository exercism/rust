# Fizzy

FizzBuzz is a children's game of counting through the integers. For each of them, if it's divisible by three, substitute the word "fizz"; if divisible by five, substitute "buzz"; if both, say both; if neither, say the number. It is not particularly difficult to implement, though it enjoyed some popularity for a time as [a quick way to tell whether entry-level programming applicants knew how to program _at all_](https://blog.codinghorror.com/why-cant-programmers-program/).

It has since fallen somewhat into disfavor for that task, because applicants began memorizing FizzBuzz implementations instead of learning to program.

We're going to do something more interesting than the basics: your task in this exercise is to implement FizzBuzz:

- with fully-customizable rules about what numbers produce what words
- fully generic on a very restricted minimal trait set
- such that it works just as well for the Collatz Sequence as for steadily increasing numbers
- with convenient helpers to make its use ergonomic

## Rust Installation

Refer to the [exercism help page][help-page] for Rust installation and learning
resources.

## Writing the Code

Execute the tests with:

```bash
$ cargo test
```

All but the first test have been ignored. After you get the first test to
pass, open the tests source file which is located in the `tests` directory
and remove the `#[ignore]` flag from the next test and get the tests to pass
again. Each separate test is a function with `#[test]` flag above it.
Continue, until you pass every test.

If you wish to run all ignored tests without editing the tests source file, use:

```bash
$ cargo test -- --ignored
```

To run a specific test, for example `some_test`, you can use:

```bash
$ cargo test some_test
```

If the specific test is ignored use:

```bash
$ cargo test some_test -- --ignored
```

To learn more about Rust tests refer to the [online test documentation][rust-tests]

Make sure to read the [Modules][modules] chapter if you
haven't already, it will help you with organizing your files.

## Further improvements

After you have solved the exercise, please consider using the additional utilities, described in the [installation guide](https://exercism.io/tracks/rust/installation), to further refine your final solution.

To format your solution, inside the solution directory use

```bash
cargo fmt
```

To see, if your solution contains some common ineffective use cases, inside the solution directory use

```bash
cargo clippy --all-targets
```

## Submitting the solution

Generally you should submit all files in which you implemented your solution (`src/lib.rs` in most cases). If you are using any external crates, please consider submitting the `Cargo.toml` file. This will make the review process faster and clearer.
